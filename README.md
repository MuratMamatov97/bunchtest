This project includes tests which cover the main functionality of bunch help centre.

**Reasoning for writing particular tests**
1. Tests should cover the general functionality of the help centre
2. Tests should contain the coverage of search function
3. Since it is help centre, the intercom should also work so users could ask their questions and get support


**Usage**

You can run all the tests by writing in terminal
"npx playwright test"

Otherwise you can run any of them by annotations described in package.json file by writing in terminal 
"npm run {annotation}"
